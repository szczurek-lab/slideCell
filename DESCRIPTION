Description: Predicting synthetic lethal gene A gene B infractions using high-throughput gene dependence screens performed on cancer cell lines from CCLE.   The package includes 4 preprocessed data sets: 2 from project DRIVE (Ataris and RSA - the same RNAi experiment, different dependency calculating algorithms) and 2 from project Achilles (Demeter - RNAi experiment, AC - CRISPR-Cas9) curated in 2018, with CCLE cell lines as rows and silenced genes B in columns. It also includes matrix with information about mutations present in the cell lines with CCLE cell lines as rows and mutated genes A in columns.    It contains two methods for SL discovery: SPID i.e. Wilcoxon rank-sum test and SPEA i.e. Enrichment Analysis, which check SL potential of user defined list of potential SL pairs and also plotting functions.
